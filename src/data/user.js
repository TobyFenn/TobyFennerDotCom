	about: {
		title: "About Me",
		description: "I'm Toby, a Junior studying Computer Science and Business Administration at the University of Southern California. I chose these fields because I'm psyched about the end-to-end process of product development, encompassing design, engineering, communication, and delivery.\nOn the USC campus I conduct research in the Networked Systems Lab, working on understanding connections between pages on the web. I'm also a course producer for a C++ course. After class, I am an active member of the Scope club, where we learn a new industry-standard framework every semester. I previously I worked for the web communications team of ShiftSC.\nIn my free time, I enjoy bouldering at Cliffs of Id. I once came extremely close to meeting Alex Honnold, but my quest continues. I also collect film cameras and spend all my pocket money on expired film stocks. \nI love meeting new people!",
